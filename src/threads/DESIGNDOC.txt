---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

thread.h: In struct thread:
	struct list_elem donorelem;	// priority donor threads, 
					// they donate their priority to the current thread if it has a higher priority
	
	int64_t ticks_wakeup;   	// ticks to wakeup the thread
	
	int base_priority;   		// the priority of the base element/thread
	
	struct thread *locker;		// the locker thread who currently has acquired the resource/lock
	
	struct list prio_donors;	// threads who have acquired locks but a new thread having higher priority comes
	
	struct lock *blocked;		// blocked thread

thread.c:
	extern struct list sleep_list;    // list for sleeping threads

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

Earlier, timer_sleep() was calling thread_yield() which was 
constanting putting threads between READY queue and RUN queue, and ultimately occupying CPU.
Now, the current thread is first disabled. Then it is made to sleep (blocked) for 
given number of ticks. The thread is then inserted into a list (sleep_list) which is done by 
comparing the number of ticks, so that we can prioritize the thread with an earlier wake-up time.

	cur_level = intr_disable();
	cur_thread = thread_current();

	cur_thread->ticks_wakeup = timer_ticks() + ticks;
	list_insert_ordered (&sleep_list, &cur_thread->elem, cmp_ticks_wakeup, NULL);

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

We have added the main handling on the thread side of code, so the handling
is transfered from the timer interrupt to reduce time spent there.
The ticks compare method and sleeping thread list are both on the thread side.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

The priorities of each thread is compared (cmp_cond_priority and cmp_priority) and 
then added to the thread queue accordingly. The code in sema_up() in the synch.c is 
also changed a bit to make the queue, a priority queue. 

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

The interrupt is disabled before going into the "critical section" so as to avoid such 
problem. Later we enable it again.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We had initially considered adding a scheduling method in the timer.c file
but it had cluttered the code and also was not optimised. 


    		     PROD/CONS
	  		     =========

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B1: How does your solution guarantee that consumers will hold until
>> there is something to consume in the buffer?

In our solution, there is a check on the number of items in the buffer, 
and if that number is zero, there is a wait for the 'full' condition:

	while(buf_count == 0)
            cond_wait(&full,&lock);

Therefore, a consumer will only proceed to consume if there is an item in the buffer, 
since the full condition only gets signalled when the producer produces an item.

>> B2: How does your solution guarantee that producers will hold until
>> there is some free space in the buffer?

As in the answer above, there is a similar check in the producer thread, 
to check if the buffer is full:
	
	while(buf_count == MAX)
            cond_wait(&empty, &lock);

The empty condition only gets signalled when a consumer consumes an item, and hence the buffer is 
emptied by atleast 1 item. 

>> B3: How does your solution preserve a FIFO semantics i.e., the first
>> character produced will be the first to be consumed?

This is managed by using seperate indices for the producer and consumer positions 
('producer_pos' and 'consumer_pos') in the buffer. They are only incremented in the critical section 
and hence only one thread accesses them. So, FIFA semantics are maintained.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B4: Give an intuition for why your program preserves safety.

To preserve safety, the producer consumer code must ensure mutual exclusion when any changes
to the buffer are made. In our solution, all the changes to the buffer and other variables 
are all done when the lock is acquired by the thread. So, there is no possibility of two threads 
performing any operation in the critical section, since only one thread can have the lock.
Hence, the program definitely preserves safety.

>> B5: Why did you choose this design? Did you consider other design
>> alternatives? In what ways is it superior to another design you considered?

This design uses two condition variables and a lock. 
An alternative was to use just one condition variable and a lock.
But that design had a possibility of deadlock.
This solution is elegant and some what symmetric, and hence we chose this.


			     NARROW BRIDGE
			     =============

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C1: How does your solution guarantee that no more than 3 vehicles
>> are crossing the bridge in the same direction?

We have created a semaphore "space" whose initial value is 3. 
It is being decremented in the ArriveBridge() method and accordingly changed in the
ExitBridge() method. The variables can be more than 3 but because of this semaphore,
the number of vehicles on the bridge will never exceed 3.

>> C2: What prevents vehicles from opposite directions from crossing the
>> bridge simultaneously?

In the ArriveBridge() method, the following code block maintains this condition:

		if (currentDirection != direc && active > 0)
	  	{
	  		printf("Waiting\n");
	    		waiting++; 											
	    		sema_up(&mutex);
	    		sema_down(&direction[direc]);
	  	} 

This checks if the current direction of vehicles is different and if it is then the
vehicles on the other side go to waiting state.

>> C3: How does your solution grant priority to emergency vehicles over
>> the queue of vehicles ahead in the same direction?

It checks if there are any emergency vehicles for a given direction then while creating 
the thread the priority of thread is set as "1" as follows:
thread_create("left emergency", 1, OneVehicle, (void *)LEFT);
Since these threads will be given priority over normal vehicles in thread creating and scheduling.

>> C4: How do you guarantee that despite having priority, emergency vehicles
>> do not start crossing the bridge while there are still vehicles crossing
>> it in the oposite direction?

Since the priority is only given while thread creating and scheduling, and not inside the
thread function itself, this scenario would not occur. Each vehicle, including emergency ones,
are passed to the same function, OneVehicle, the checks of direction and crossing stand for
each type of vehicle. The Semaphores used ensure this. There is no priority involved 'inside'
the functions.

>> C5: Explain with examples why your solution does not preserve neither
>> fairness nor freedom from starvation, other than what has been indicated
>> for emergency vehicles.

Since the ordering of the semaphores is handled properly, starvation doesn't occur. This order
of semaphores was done after reading the producer consumer and reader writer problems. The emergency
vehicles, as stated in the above answer, are only given priority while creating and scheduling threads,
so the constraints of the problem, i.e., the direction and number of vehicles remain satisfied.

---- RATIONALE ----

>> C6: Why did you choose this design? Did you consider other design
>> alternatives? In what ways is it superior to another design you considered?

This was the solution that clicked first and it worked. So we stuck with this design.


			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

The "Narrow-Bridge" problem was a little tricky than it seemed at first.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

While doing the "Alarm Clock" task, we got deeper insights in the 
scheduling and "Narrow-Bridge" taught many things like the proper
usage of semaphores and priority scheduling.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future semesters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?
-

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future semesters or the remaining projects?
