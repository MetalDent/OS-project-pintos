			     ALARM CLOCK
			     ===========

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

/* modified or new data structures */
>> thread.h: In struct thread
	struct list_elem donorelem;	// priority donor threads
	int64_t ticks_wakeup;   	// ticks to wakeup 
	int base_priority;   		// the priority of the base element/thread
	struct thread *locker;		// the locker thread who currently has acquired the resource
	struct list prio_donors;	// threads who have acquired locks but a new thread having higher priority comes
	struct lock *blocked;		// blocked thread

>> thread.c:
	extern struct list sleep_list;    // list for sleeping threads

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

>>>> Earlier, timer_sleep() was calling thread_yield() which was 
>>>> constanting putting threads between READY queue and RUN queue, and ultimately occupying CPU.
>>>> Now, the current thread is first disabled. Then it is made to sleep (blocked) for 
>>>> given number of ticks. The thread is then inserted into a list (sleep_list) which is done by 
>>>> comparing the number of ticks, so that we can prioritize the thread with an earlier wake-up time.

>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

>>>> \o/

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

>>>> The priorities of each thread is compared (cmp_cond_priority and cmp_priority) and 
>>>> then added to the thread queue accordingly. The code in sema_up() in the synch.c is 
>>>> also changed a bit to make the queue, a priority queue. 

>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

    		     PROD/CONS
	  		     =========

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B1: How does your solution guarantee that consumers will hold until
>> there is something to consume in the buffer?

>>>> In our solution, there is a check on the number of items in the buffer, and if that number is zero, there is a wait for the 'full' condition:

	while(buf_count == 0)
            cond_wait(&full,&lock);

Therefore, a consumer will only proceed to consume if there is an item in the buffer, since the full condition only gets signalled when the producer produces an item.


>> B2: How does your solution guarantee that producers will hold until
>> there is some free space in the buffer?

>>>> As in the answer above, there is a similar check in the producer thread, to check if the buffer is full:
	
	while(buf_count == MAX)
            cond_wait(&empty, &lock);

The empty condition only gets signalled when a consumer consumes an item, and hence the buffer is emptied by atleast 1 item. 

>> B3: How does your solution preserve a FIFO semantics i.e., the first
>> character produced will be the first to be consumed?

>>>> This is managed by using seperate indices for the producer and consumer positions ('producer_pos' and 'consumer_pos') in the buffer. They are only incremented in the critical section and hence only one thread accesses them.
So, FIFA semantics are maintained.
---- RATIONALE ----

>> B4: Give an intuition for why your program preserves safety.

>>>> To preserve safety, the producer consumer code must ensure mutual exclusion when any changes to the buffer are made.
In our solution, all the changes to the buffer and other variables are all done when the lock is acquired by the thread. So, there is no possibility of two threads performing any operation in the critical section, since only one thread can have the lock.
Hence, the program definitely preserves safety.

>> B5: Why did you choose this design? Did you consider other design
>> alternatives? In what ways is it superior to another design you considered?

>>>> This design uses two condition variables and a lock. An alternative was to use just one condition variable and a lock.


			     NARROW BRIDGE
			     =============

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> C1: How does your solution guarantee that no more than 3 vehicles
>> are crossing the bridge in the same direction?

>>>> The procedure "isSafe()" checks how many vehicles are currently on the bridge 
>>>> and in which direction.

>> C2: What prevents vehicles from opposite directions from crossing the
>> bridge simultaneously?

>>>> The procedure "isSafe()" checks if there are any vehicle in the given direction 
>>>> and how many vehicles are currently on the bridge.

>> C3: How does your solution grant priority to emergency vehicles over
>> the queue of vehicles ahead in the same direction?

>>>> It checks if there are any emergency vehicles for a given direction then while creating 
>>>> the thread the priority of thread is set as "1" as follows:
>>>> thread_create("left emergency", 1, OneVehicle, (void *)LEFT);

>> C4: How do you guarantee that despite having priority, emergency vehicles
>> do not start crossing the bridge while there are still vehicles crossing
>> it in the oposite direction?

>>>> \o/

>> C5: Explain with examples why your solution does not preserve neither
>> fairness nor freedom from starvation, other than what has been indicated
>> for emergency vehicles.

>>>> \o/

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

>>>> The "Narrow-Bridge" problem was a little tricky than it seemed at first.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave
>> you greater insight into some aspect of OS design?

>>>> While doing the "Alarm Clock" task, we got deeper insights in the 
>>>> scheduling and "Narrow-Bridge" taught many things like the proper
>>>> usage of semaphores and priority scheduling.

>> Is there some particular fact or hint we should give students in
>> future semesters to help them solve the problems?  Conversely, did you
>> find any of our guidance to be misleading?

>>>> \o/

>> Do you have any suggestions for the TAs to more effectively assist
>> students, either for future semesters or the remaining projects?

>>>> \o/

>> Any other comments?
